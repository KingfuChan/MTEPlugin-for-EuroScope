## What

MTEPlugin is an [EuroScope](https://www.euroscope.hu) plugin providing miscellaneous tag enhancements including altitude, speed, vertical speed, indicators, warnings etc., and with abundant customizable features.

## How

MTEPlugin uses multiple modules to simulate some Eurocat style functions. Also some WinAPI is used to achieve certain goal.

Download plugin from [release page](https://github.com/KingfuChan/MTEPlugin-for-EuroScope/releases).

## Why

Native EuroScope doesn't provide Eurocat style tag items. Although [Topsky plugin by VATSIM-Scandinavia](https://vatsim-scandinavia.org/forums/topic/3461-topsky-plugin-241/) has profuse features, still some features don't work as desired, especially those related to metric unit system. So MTEPlugin is developed to supplement EuroScope native items and functions as well as those from Topsky, and to improve controller experience with some other functionalities.

The initiative of MTEPlugin is by [VATPRC](https://www.vatprc.net) staff's request, since the airspace differs a lot from most regions. Therefore some features accomodated their needs. Generally speaking, MTEPlugin should not only help VATPRC controllers, but also suitable for other divisions or platforms using EuroScope.
